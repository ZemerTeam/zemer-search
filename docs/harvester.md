# Harvester

`harness/` (the InnerTube + net layer) + `harvester/` (the harvest logic). Turns the whitelist into a
complete-discography corpus, safely.

## The InnerTube layer (`harness/`)

Ported from the app's `tests/` so it reproduces the app's exact request path.

- Browse and search are **unauthenticated** — no cookie, no `visitorData`. (A stale/flagged shared
  `visitorData` actually caused *empty* results; sending none is reliable — see commit `df162b8`.)
- `clients.mjs` — the `WEB_REMIX` client constants (mirrors `YouTubeClient.kt`).
- `browse.mjs` — `postBrowse({browseId, params, continuation, maxAgeMs})` + faithful parsers:
  `parseArtistPage` (sections: songs shelf, album/single/playlist carousels, **+ the artist's regular
  channel id** from the header subscribe button, **+ header thumbnail**), `parseArtistItems` /
  `parseArtistItemsContinuation` (grid/shelf pagination), `parsePlaylistPage` (album/playlist tracks).
  Rows parse to `{kind: "song"|"album"|"playlist", …}`; `songFromMRLIR` also extracts the **per-row
  artist channel id** (used for playlist whitelisting).
- `whitelist.mjs` — fetches the world-readable Firestore `artistsWhitelist` collection (project/apiKey
  from the app's `google-services.json`, **read-only**) → `data/whitelist.json` (~1608 artists).

## The IP-safe net layer (`harness/net.mjs`) — the most important safety code

**Every** YouTube request goes through `cachedPost(url, headers, body, {maxAgeMs})`:

1. **Gzipped disk cache** keyed by `sha1(POST url body)` in `data/.httpcache/*.json.gz`. A page is
   fetched **at most once, ever** (browse JSON compresses ~10×). `maxAgeMs` lets maintenance re-fetch a
   stale landing page (default = forever).
2. **Single-flight + rate limit:** one live request at a time, ≥ `MIN_INTERVAL_MS` (default 900) +
   `JITTER_MS` between live requests.
3. **Anti-bot abort:** if YouTube returns a "Sorry…" challenge page, it returns `{blocked:true}` and the
   harvest **stops immediately** to protect the IP.

`netStats()` reports live/cache/block counts. **Never add a raw `fetch`** — route through `net.mjs`.

> A full 1,608-artist harvest is many thousands of paced requests over hours. Let it grow **politely over
> time** (it self-aborts on a block, and the cache makes every restart resume for free). Don't blast it.

## Per-artist harvest (`harvester/core.mjs`)

`harvestArtist(artist, browse, {landingMaxAgeMs})` returns the artist's complete catalog as **typed
entities**:

- **tracks** — the Songs shelf + Videos shelf, fully paginated via continuations, **plus every album's
  tracks** (each album page is `browse("VL"+playlistId)`). This album expansion is what makes it a
  *complete* discography rather than just the Songs shelf.
- **albums** — album/single/EP entities with `{id (MPRE browseId), playlistId, title, type, year,
  thumbnail}`. `type` is derived from the release subtitle ("Album • 2023" / "Single • 2024").
- **playlists** — the artist's playlist entities `{id, title, thumbnail}`.
- **albumTracks** — `(albumId, videoId, pos)` membership, captured during album expansion (powers the
  album detail page).
- **regularChannelId** — the artist's regular-upload channel (from the page header subscribe button).
- **thumbnail** — the artist image.

`browse` is injected so callers control cache policy and so a block throws `BlockError` (clean abort).

**Whitelist-purity guard (`ownsRow`).** YouTube Music's artist **Songs/Videos shelves are polluted** — the
"Videos" feed (and its `more` pagination) mixes in rows uploaded by *other* channels: foreign garbage
(Tamil/Lil Wayne/gospel), third-party Jewish covers, and re-uploads (e.g. YBC videos posted by "EG
Productions"). Stamping the page artist on every shelf row stored that junk under a whitelisted artist. So
`add()` now keeps a row only if its **own** artist channel (`rowArtistId` — captured per row by
`songFromMRLIR` and `fromTwoRow`) is whitelisted: `ownsRow(rowArtistId, owned, whitelist)` where `owned` =
the artist's own music + regular channel and `whitelist` = the full whitelisted-channel set (so feat.
collabs by other whitelisted artists survive). A row with **no** captured artist is trusted to the page.
Callers (`harvest`/`onboard`/`refresh`) pass the whitelist set. **`harvester/reconcile.mjs`** is the
one-time cleanup for already-stored junk: it re-parses every artist from the **cache** (offline, zero
YouTube calls) and purges tracks whose row artist is a non-whitelisted uploader — purging **only** rows it
positively finds as foreign (a cache miss never deletes). `DRY=1` reports first. Same whitelist-purity rule
the community playlists use (gotcha #17).

**Prefer-video for cross-listed ids (gotcha #18).** A `videoId` can be a music VIDEO on one artist's page
and an audio SONG on another's; since it's stored once (PK), it could land as a song and never appear in the
Videos category. `add()` upgrades `isVideo` when the same id reappears on the Videos shelf, and
`upsertArtistCatalog` does `ON CONFLICT … isVideo=MAX(track.isVideo, excluded.isVideo)` (never downgrades).
**`harvester/backfill-video-flags.mjs`** (cache-only, `DRY=1`) flips already-stored songs to video for ids
listed as a video anywhere. Attribution stays the PK owner (no duplicate same-id results).

## Initial harvest, onboarding, refresh, prune

The four entry points (all upsert **one artist's whole catalog per `db.transaction`** → durable per-artist
checkpoints, crash/kill safe; all abort on the first anti-bot block and resume from cache; all exit `75`
on a block so the wrapper can stop the pipeline):

- **`harvester/harvest.mjs`** (`N`): first N whitelisted UC artists, full catalog, forever-cache. The
  initial bulk build.
- **`harvester/onboard.mjs`**: harvests only the **new** whitelisted artists (in `whitelist.json` but not
  yet in `corpus.db`); existing artists are skipped. Full catalog. **Only persists an artist with ≥1
  track** — a transient fetch error yields 0 tracks and is *not* written (so it isn't stranded as a
  0-track row; it's retried next run). A no-op (0 live requests) when nothing is new.
- **`harvester/refresh.mjs`** (`MAX_AGE_H` default 20, `SHALLOW`): re-harvests **all** artist rows in
  `corpus.db` (incl. 0-track ones, so a transiently-failed harvest recovers), re-fetching landing + shelf
  pages with a **TTL** to catch new releases while immutable album pages keep their forever-cache. Upserts
  only-new (`INSERT … ON CONFLICT`); **never deletes**, so a shallow pass can't shrink the corpus. On a
  block it writes a `"blocked"` status (distinct from `"done"`).
  - **deep** (default — bare `node harvester/refresh.mjs`): full pagination of every song/video/album
    shelf. Preserves the historical refresh behavior, so an existing cron keeps catching items anywhere.
  - **shallow** (`SHALLOW=1`): landing page + its carousels + (new) album expansion only — ~1 request/
    artist; new releases surface at the top of the landing carousels. The fast daily pass.
- **Blocklist (`data/blocklist.json`** — `{videoIds:[…], artistIds:[…]}`, committed like `synonyms.json`):
  curated junk to exclude **regardless of the whitelist** — for track-level junk under an otherwise-wanted
  artist (the whitelist is artist-granularity). `upsertArtistCatalog` never stores a blocklisted id (so a
  re-harvest can't re-add it) and `prune.mjs` deletes any existing blocklisted rows (`pruneBlocklisted`).
- **`harvester/prune.mjs`** (`PRUNE_MIN_RATIO` default 0.5): applies the blocklist, then removes artists no longer on the whitelist
  (and all their rows, one transaction) so a de-whitelisted artist stops being searchable. **Safety guard
  (`prunePlan`, unit-tested):** refuses unless ≥ `PRUNE_MIN_RATIO` of the **current** artists *survive*
  (corpus ∩ whitelist) — comparing survivors, not raw whitelist size, so a plausibly-sized-but-wrong
  whitelist can't wipe the corpus. A bad ratio value falls back to 0.5.

**`scripts/maintain.sh [shallow|deep]`** orchestrates the lot under a `flock`, in order: `whitelist`
refetch → `onboard` → **`prune` → `refresh`** (prune first so refresh doesn't re-harvest doomed artists).
An anti-bot block in any step **aborts the whole pipeline** (no more live requests at a flagged IP). Uses
a fast-but-IP-safe profile (`CONCURRENCY=5`, `MIN_INTERVAL_MS=200`). Schedule daily shallow + weekly deep,
**Shabbat-aware** — see [deployment.md](deployment.md).

## Community playlists (pilot)

Goal: surface **community-built YTM playlists** (curated by users, not whitelisted artists) — *as many as
possible* — while serving **whitelisted tracks only**. Two independent guarantees:

- **Purity (hard).** The `/playlist` endpoint re-fetches a playlist live and keeps only its whitelisted
  tracks (`tracksByIds` ∪ `whitelistedChannelIds`). This is **id-based**, so opening *any* playlist —
  community, artist, or even unindexed — can only ever render whitelisted tracks. Discovery never weakens
  this; a community playlist is just "a community ordering of (the whitelisted subset of) some tracks."
- **Admission (quality).** `admitPlaylist({total, whitelisted})` admits only if **≥ `MIN_WL_TRACKS`**
  (default 4) **AND ≥ `MIN_WL_RATIO`** (default 0.5) whitelisted — so we don't surface a 4%-whitelisted
  fragment. This is *not* a purity gate (purity is the serve-time filter); it's a "is this a coherent
  list?" gate. **Never** admit on "contains *any* whitelisted track" — that's the leaky inverse (gotcha #14).

**`harvester/playlists.mjs`** (`npm run playlists`) — there is no global "all playlists" enumeration on
YouTube, so discovery **seeds from search** (IP-safe via `harness/search.mjs` → `net.mjs`):

1. **Seeds** (`buildSeeds`): curated topical terms (`data/playlist-seeds.json`) + whitelisted artist names
   + (with `FIRSTNAMES=1`) each artist's first name. `SEEDS=topics|artists|both` (default `both`), `N` caps
   the seed budget. Full sweep: `SEEDS=both FIRSTNAMES=1 N=4000`.
2. **Discover**: search each seed with the community-playlist `SearchFilter` → candidate playlist ids
   (already-known ids skipped unless `RECHECK`/`REVALIDATE`).
3. **Check + gate**: fetch each candidate's tracks (`CAP` default 300), intersect with the corpus, apply
   `admitPlaylist`. Keepers → `upsertCommunityPlaylist` (playlist + whitelisted membership, one
   transaction). `PAGES` sets search pages per seed.
4. **"Remove what's not"**: `RECHECK=1` re-validates re-discovered playlists and **deletes** ones that now
   fail the gate; `REVALIDATE=1` re-checks **every** stored community playlist (even if not re-found) and
   deletes failures + refreshes the rest. `pruneBlocklisted` also strips blocklisted videoIds from
   community membership and re-syncs counts.

**Metadata safety (the audio is already pure; this hardens what's *displayed*).** A playlist's title,
curator name, and cover are user-generated:
- **Cover** — derived from a **whitelisted track** at read time (`store.mjs`), never the curator's cover
  image (which can be a mosaic of the playlist's non-whitelisted tracks). Applies retroactively to all rows.
- **Title / curator text** — screened at admission against `blocklist.json` `playlistTerms` (case-insensitive
  substrings); a hit rejects the playlist (and removes it on `REVALIDATE`/`RECHECK`). You own this list.
- **Specific removals** — `blocklist.json` `playlistIds` (your manual backstop). `upsertCommunityPlaylist`
  refuses a blocklisted id; `pruneBlocklisted` deletes existing ones.

**Whitelist-review report.** Each run writes `data/rejected-artists.json` (gitignored, regenerated per run):
the **non-whitelisted artist channels** whose tracks were dropped from the community playlists, tallied and
sorted by frequency (`count  artistName  channelId  channelUrl  sample_track`) — the strongest candidates
to add to the whitelist lead. It can also be produced **from cache** (no live requests) via the net layer's
`cacheOnly` option, so it's safe to regenerate alongside a running scan.

IP-safe like every other step: paced/cached/circuit-broken, aborts on the first anti-bot block → exit 75.
Re-runs are free (cache replay). Progress writes to the status channel → the web UI shows "Discovering
community playlists (discover|check) — N / total"; results get their **own Community chip** (browse-all via
`/community`, no search needed). Stored in `community_playlist` / `community_playlist_track`
([store.md](store.md)); separate from the artist-owned `playlist` table, so the pilot is fully reversible.

## Release dating (New Releases accuracy)

Browse pages carry only a release **year**; the real date lives in the `/player` microformat (`uploadDate`,
full ISO-8601). **`harvester/releases.mjs`** (`npm run releases`) dates releases *cheaply*: for each album
lacking `uploadDate` but with a sample track (we already store `album_track`), it fetches **one `/player`**
on that sample and stores the date on the album — **one request per release, never per track**. Incremental
(skips already-dated albums; `/player` responses are cached, so re-runs replay free), album-type + recent-year
first, IP-safe (paced, aborts on a block → exit 75). A song inherits its album's date, so dating albums also
orders the New Releases Songs list.

This is what makes New Releases truthful: `recentAlbums`/`recentTracks` order by the real date, and `/new`
shows **only items dated within a window** (default 10 days). Without it, ordering fell back to `harvestedAt`
(index time) and old catalog we'd *just indexed* looked "new". Env: `MIN_YEAR` (restrict to recent),
`LIMIT`, plus the usual `net.mjs` pacing vars. Standalone **videos** (not in an album) aren't dated yet, so
they don't appear in the windowed view — closing that would need a `/player` per video.

## The channel map & issue #108

The whitelist holds YouTube **Music** channel ids. Artists' *uploads* (live videos, older content, music
videos) live on their **regular** YouTube channel — a *different* id. The harvest stores
`artist.regularChannelId` so playlist tracks uploaded to the artist's regular channel can be verified as
whitelisted (`whitelistedChannelIds` = music ids ∪ regular ids).

**Issue #108:** content that exists *only* on an artist's regular channel (not surfaced on their YT Music
page) is **not harvested yet**. Closing it means harvesting each regular channel's Videos/Releases/
Playlists tabs and deduping by videoId — bounded by the IP/storage budget. The channel map is the
groundwork.

## Whitelist data quality

zemer-search is a faithful mirror of the whitelist — it indexes *exactly* what's whitelisted. So it
doubles as a **whitelist auditor**: an off-policy artist in Firestore becomes searchable and obvious here
(the app shows them too, for the same reason). Fix such entries in Firestore, then re-fetch the whitelist
and re-harvest. (zemer-search has **zero** leakage beyond the whitelist — verified by `fuzz`.)
